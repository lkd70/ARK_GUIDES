# Ark Security 101

I hate sounding like the bossy guy, but please, please read this all and understand it. Please contact me if you have any concerns or questions. This is so important not just for yourself but for the entire tribe.

_"I already know what you're going to say, I'm not reading all that"_. No, read it fully.


Solid security is a **requirement** for TPG.

Recently there's been several "hackings". Yes I'm sure we all think _"that cannot happen to me"_, _"no one has my details"_. This is irrelevant. It is 100% **crucial** that you ensure you've done the following.

## I have a Steam account

For steam accounts there's two ways to approach security, both of which have additional steps you must follow.

### The Password

First things first, the password, Of course you need one of these. It must be **unique** that means you **don't** use this password for anything else. it's **only** used for this one steam account.


### Steam Guard

Secondly there's two options for the additional security. These are called [Steam Guard](https://store.steampowered.com/twofactor/manage). You **must** ensure you have this enabled. This is that "2FA" rule everyone talks about...

To get started, head over to the [Steam Guard] page and choose either the first or second option. You must **not** choose the "turn Steam Guard off" option.

The first steam guard option (marked as "1") is _"Get Steam Guard codes from the Steam app on my phone"_. This uses the Steam mobile app to show a code on your phone everytime you log in to Steam on a new device. This is the best method.

The second option (marked as "2") is _"Get Steam Guard codes by email (will require you to re-login)"_. This will send you a code via your email address associated with your steam account when you log in to steam on a new device. Should you choose this option please **ensure** that you also have 2FA enabled on your Email account. Listed below are instructions for a few popular email providers on setting up 2FA. Yet again if you need help please don't hesitate to ask me.

### Deauthorize

Great! So once you've followed step 1 and 2 you now have a Steam account that is fully secured, but wait, there's more!
You now need to forcefully **deauthorize** all other sessions. This is to ensure any devices which were previously logged in with your Steam account are no longer logged in. It's good practice to do this every now and then.

To do so, head over to the [Steam Guard](https://store.steampowered.com/twofactor/manage) page again and select the option to _"Deauthorize all other devices"_ near the bottom.

## I have an Epic account

Epic accounts have a lot more options in terms of security. Because of this it can be a little more confusing. If you need any assistance please do contact me.

### The Password
Yes, you need a password. Not only do you need a password, your password **must** be unique. You **cannot** use the same password for **anything** else. One password to one account, simples. You can change your password on the [Epic Games Security Page](https://www.epicgames.com/account/password?lang=en&productName=epicgames).

### Two-Factor Authentication
This is that "2FA" that we talk about in the TPG rules. This **must** be setup and in use. Epic provides 3 different approaches to this, we'll go over them all below, though the first option is highly recommended.

1. 2FA Option 1: _"Third-Party Authenticator App"_. This method requires you to download an app on your phone/computer/smart fridge/whatever which will store a secret and tell you a code everytime you try to log in to a new device. There's a never ending list of these "2FA TOTP" apps, but here's the most common two: [Authy](https://authy.com/) and [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US). Though both are fine, since Google Authenticator is linked to your Google account it is potentially less secure. I recommend Authy.

To set up Third Party Authentication Apps take a peak at Epics own [guide](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/epic-accounts-c5719348850459/account-security-c5719366891291/two-factor-authentication-2fa-and-how-to-enable-it-a5720249664923). If you get stuck, drop me a message.

2. 2FA Option 2: _"SMS Authentication"_ Put simply, enabling this will send you a text message to your personal phone number everytime you log in to your Epic account on a new device. Do **not** use a virtual phone number for this.

3. 2FA Option 3: _"Email Authentication"_ Much like the above option, this will send you a code to your email address associated with your Epic Games account whenever you log in from a new device. This is the weakest of the three options and should be avoided if possible. However if you do plan to use this method, please also ensure you have 2FA enabled on your email account. Listed below are instructions for a few popular email providers on setting up 2FA. Yet again if you need help please don't hesitate to ask me.

### Sign Out Everywhere

Great! So once you've followed step 1 and 2 you now have a Epic account that is fully secured, but wait, there's more!
You now need to forcefully **sign out** of all other sessions. This is to ensure any devices which were previously logged in with your Epic account are no longer logged in. It's good practice to do this every now and then.

To do so, head over to the [Epic Games Security](https://www.epicgames.com/account/password?lang=en&productName=epicgames) page again and select the option to _"sign out other sessions"_.

### Done!

That's all, sorry for the harsh sounding 20,000 word essay on security, but it's something that concerns me - I don't mean to come across as a meanie but I can't express how important your accounts security is not only to you, but to everyone in the tribe.

Thanks for taking the time. Any questions or if you need a hand to ensure you've done everything right, please **please** send me a message.
